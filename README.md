A Keplerian Orbital Mechanics & Astrophysical Analysis Tool.

Lemo Engine is a Python-based terminal dashboard designed to calculate and visualize the trajectories of celestial bodies. Born from a fascination with the "software" of the universe, this tool bridges the gap between raw astronomical data and visual orbital projections.

The universe isn't just random; it's governed by precise constants. Even the Starlink logo is more than a brand-it's a visual representation of a Hohmann Transfer Orbit, a mathematical bridge between two worlds. Lemo Engine aims to calculate those bridges.
key features:
 Keplerian Solver: Uses Newton-Raphson iteration to solve the transcendental Kepler Equation (M = E-e \sin E) for high-precision orbital positions.
Distance Analytics: Calculates parallax angles, distance in light-years AU meters and persecs).

Terminal Visualizations: Real-time plotting of eccentric orbits using plotext and rich.

Technical Stack: 
 Language: Python3 CLI F: Click
 Formatting: Rich

 Math: Math
 
 Future Upgrades:
 
 Stellar Proper Motion (Mapping the movement of stars over centuries).
 Atmospheric Refraction correction.
 Light-time lag integration for observer-to-planet COordinates.
 weins displacement and why at that temperature a 'black body' appears as it is. or emits light at a certain
wavelength. 
and more..
